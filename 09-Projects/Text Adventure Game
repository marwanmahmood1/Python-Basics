# ================================
#     HOW TO EXPAND THIS GAME
# ================================
# 1. Add More Choices:
#    - Instead of just "left" or "right", add more paths (forest, cave, river).
#    - Each choice can lead to different outcomes.
#
# 2. Add Enemies:
#    - Create an Enemy class with health and attack power.
#    - Let the player fight enemies using a simple combat system.
#
# 3. Add Items & Inventory System:
#    - Expand the add_item() method to include weapons, potions, or keys.
#    - Use items to restore health or unlock new areas.
#
# 4. Add Branching Storylines:
#    - Choices can affect the ending (multiple endings).
#    - Example: Helping someone may reward you later in the story.
#
# 5. Add Win/Loss Conditions:
#    - Win by reaching a treasure or defeating a final boss.
#    - Lose if health reaches zero or if you make the wrong choices.
#
# By expanding step by step, you can turn this simple demo
# into a full text-based RPG adventure! ðŸš€
