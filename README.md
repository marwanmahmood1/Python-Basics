## üõ†Ô∏è Project Details  

### üõ°Ô∏è Project 1 ‚Äì Password Strength Checker  
A beginner-friendly CLI application that evaluates password strength based on:  
- Length  
- Uppercase & lowercase letters  
- Numbers  
- Special characters  

It also checks against a small list of common weak passwords and provides feedback for improvement.
