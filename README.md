## üõ†Ô∏è Project Details  

### üõ°Ô∏è Project 1 ‚Äì Password Strength Checker  
A beginner-friendly CLI application that evaluates password strength based on:  
- Length  
- Uppercase & lowercase letters  
- Numbers  
- Special characters  

It also checks against a small list of common weak passwords and provides feedback for improvement.  


## üéÆ Project 2 ‚Äì Text Adventure Game

This project is a simple text-based adventure game.  
- The player navigates through different rooms, makes choices, and can collect items in their inventory.  
- It‚Äôs designed to teach you about **functions, conditionals, loops, and basic game logic** in Python.

### Improving The Game
This project is designed as a base you can build on. Some ideas:

1. **More Choices** ‚Äì Add new locations (forest, cave, river) with unique outcomes.  
2. **Enemies** ‚Äì Create an `Enemy` class and add simple combat (attack, defend, health).  
3. **Items & Inventory** ‚Äì Expand the inventory with potions, weapons, and keys. Items can heal or unlock new areas.  
4. **Branching Storylines** ‚Äì Choices can impact the story‚Äôs direction and endings. Example: helping an NPC may reward you later.  
5. **Win/Loss Conditions** ‚Äì Define victory by reaching treasure or defeating a final boss, and defeat by losing all health.
