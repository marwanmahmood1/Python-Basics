## üõ†Ô∏è Project Details  

### üõ°Ô∏è Project 1 ‚Äì Password Strength Checker  
A beginner-friendly CLI application that evaluates password strength based on:  
- Length  
- Uppercase & lowercase letters  
- Numbers  
- Special characters  

It also checks against a small list of common weak passwords and provides feedback for improvement.  


## üéÆ Project 2 ‚Äì Text Adventure Game

This project is a simple text-based adventure game.  
- The player navigates through different rooms, makes choices, and can collect items in their inventory.  
- It‚Äôs designed to teach you about **functions, conditionals, loops, and basic game logic** in Python.

### Improving The Game
This project is designed as a base you can build on. Some ideas:

1. **More Choices** ‚Äì Add new locations (forest, cave, river) with unique outcomes.  
2. **Enemies** ‚Äì Create an `Enemy` class and add simple combat (attack, defend, health).  
3. **Items & Inventory** ‚Äì Expand the inventory with potions, weapons, and keys. Items can heal or unlock new areas.  
4. **Branching Storylines** ‚Äì Choices can impact the story‚Äôs direction and endings. Example: helping an NPC may reward you later.  
5. **Win/Loss Conditions** ‚Äì Define victory by reaching treasure or defeating a final boss, and defeat by losing all health.  


## üèÜ Project 3 ‚Äì Personal Expense Tracker

This project demonstrates how to build a **practical Python application** that saves and retrieves user data. It combines key programming concepts you‚Äôve learned throughout the course:

1. **File Handling** ‚Äì Reading and writing expenses to a file ensures that data persists between sessions.  
2. **Functions** ‚Äì The program is broken into smaller functions (`add_expense`, `view_expenses`, `save_expenses`) to make the code organized and reusable.  
3. **Data Structures** ‚Äì Expenses are stored as a **list of tuples** `(amount, category)` for easy management.  
4. **Error Handling** ‚Äì Input validation (like checking if the amount is a number) prevents program crashes.  
5. **User Interaction** ‚Äì A simple text menu makes the program interactive and user-friendly.  

By completing this project, you practice **real-world coding skills** while applying the fundamentals of Python in a way that directly solves a problem people face in daily life.


### Improving The Program
Once you master the basics, you can **expand this project** with new features:

- Add **date tracking** for each expense.  
- Show **monthly or weekly totals** with summaries.  
- Categorize expenses with charts using `matplotlib`.  
- Export data to **CSV or JSON files** for external use.  
- Add a **search function** to filter by category or amount.  
- Create a simple **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** with `tkinter` or `PyQt`.  

These improvements will not only make your tracker more powerful, but also help you practice **intermediate Python skills** step by step.
